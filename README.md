physiology project - quantification of delta wave density during sleep 

This project has been conducted during ESPCI practical sessions under the supervision of Prof. Thierry Gallopin. 
The document Sotty_Dagommer_Physiology_Dreem.pdf contains a thorough description of the study in French.

## Context
The project consisted in analyzing the data recorded by the Dreem headband on several people, including ESPCI students. https://dreem.com/
The dreem headband monitors several physiological signals (respiration, heart rate, electrical signals due to neuronal activity) 
thanks to numerous sensors (accelerometer, oxymeter, electro-encephalogramm).
